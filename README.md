Hello! Welcome to my GitHub :)

I am a 5th year student at the University of British Columbia (UBC), located in Vancouver, Canada! I am a Statistics major with a minor in Data Science and a Commerce concentration (BSc). 

I am currently doing statistical undergraduate research on weather extremes at UBC.

Feel free to check out some of my projects!
