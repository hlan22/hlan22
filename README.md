Hello! Welcome to my GitHub :)
<!--
I am in my last year studying at UBC in Canada! I am a Statistics major with a minor in Data Science (BSc). 

I spent my past summer doing statistical undergraduate research on weather extremes, which is what inspired me to properly set up my github. A lot of my projects are in development and therefore are private, but I hope to show a lot of them in the future on here! 

Feel free to reach out and say hi!

Do this one if streak doesn't recover:

Because realistically I shouldn't be expected to do work on the weekends anyways.
